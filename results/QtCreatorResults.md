Home: [Qt Creator](http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/)

Version: [4.6.0 beta 1](http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/02/07/qt-creator-4-6-beta-released/)

Notes:

* Only very few tests have been done at this time, but the page is created as a template
  for others to move on and contribute test results
* For all tests, the **ClangCodeModel** is enabled via "About Plugins..." followed by Preferences > C++ > CodeModel.
* Set-up the project as "File > New Project" pointing to the toplevel CMakeLists.txt and choose the Desktop kit.

# CLion

Home: [Eclipse CDT](https://eclipse.org/cdt/)

Version: 9.4.2 == [Oxygen.3](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/oxygen3rc3)

Notes:

* Only very few tests have been done at this time, but the page is created as a template
  for others to move on and contribute test results
* See this [Mailing list posting](https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/cdt-dev/msg32773.html) for available refactorings
* **Do not** import the project generated by the cmake -G'Eclipse CDT4' generator on a sibling directory, as it 
  generates duplicate resources which breaks some refactorings (see [Eclipse:532417](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=532417)).
** Instead, use **File > New > Makefile Project with Existing Code** in Eclipse CDT.
** Or use the new experimental CMake Preview (has to be installed separately from the CDT Repository)
   with File > New > C/C++ Project and "CMake Empty" type.
   See [532419](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=532419) for current status.
